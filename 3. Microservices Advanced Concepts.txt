* Asynchronous communications

			ASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATIONS ARE NOT EASY.


Most often when you hear mentions of asynchronous communications in a microservices architecture, people are specifically referring to event-driven microservices as a way to support 
eventual consistency of the data.

In this model, the services put a message into a asynchronous message broker or a temporary data store and then drive events from this state change.

The downstream event processors will process the data and eventually cause the data to be stored in its final data store.


			STREAM DATA PLATFORMS ARE A VERY STRONG PATTERN WHEN BUILDING OUT A LARGE SYSTEM ESPECIALLY WITH MANY DIFFERENT BUT INTERESTING OPERATIONS.

			ONE OF THE MOST OVERLOOKED PATTERN IN THIS SPACE IS THE TRANSITION FROM PURE SYNCHRONOUS OPERATIONS TO A SYNCHRONOUS PROCESSING.

			WHEH MOVING TO SYNCHRONOUS OPERATIONS, YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE TO HANDLE ERROR STATES CORRECTLY.
